Arduino RFIDDB
==============

This is a library for storing, matching against, and updating a list of RFID tags, stored in the EEPROM of an Arduino.

The library assumes many things:

* Your RFID tags are 10 character strings (e.g., Parallax RFID tags)
* Your EEPROM has enough memory to store all of the tags (an ATMEGA328 has 512 bytes of EEPROM storage, can store 51 tags).
* You like updating your database over Serial

Installation
------------

Place all of this great stuff in an RFIDDB folder in your Arduino software's `hardware/libraries/` directory.

Using the Library
-----------------

See the RFIDDBTest example to see how this library is used.
